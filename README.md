# liri-node-app
This app is a node based command line prompt that can return tweets, spotify searchs, and OMDB movie database results. 

NPM packages include Twitter, Spotify, Request, Dot Env, and their dependencies. 

The app meets all requirements with the exception of limiting the Twitter results down to 20, and just the ".text" portion of the response. Will work on printing only that object.
